## Welcome to Cohort 3.0 AfroCode Academy Fellowship

Welcome to the AfroCode Academy Data Science and Machine Learning Cohort 3.0 Fellowship!. We've organized the fellowship into three main parts:

- **[Stage 1: Python Programming for Data Science](#stage-1-getting-started)** - You'll learn the basics of pythons, set up your tools, and prepare for what's ahead. This stage is covered [here]()
- **[Stage 2: Data Science](#stage-2-data-science)** - This part covers data handling, from cleaning to analyzing.
- **[Stage 3: Machine Learning](#stage-3-machine-learning)** - Here, you'll dive into machine learning techniques and tools like Scikit-learn.

## Graduation Requirements

To graduate from the AfroCode Academy Data Science and Machine Learning Fellowship, fellows must meet the following criteria:

- **Completion of Curriculum**: Fellows must complete all modules within the curriculum, including the Python challenge, Data Science, Machine Learning sections, "Learning How to Learn," and "Writing in Science" courses.

- **Assignments and Medium BlogPost**: Submission of all required assignments and assigned blog post by the specified deadlines. Posts must meet the quality standards set by the mentors.

<!-- - **Attendance**: Maintain a 90% attendance rate for weekly office hours (Saturday and Sunday). See [attendance list](https://github.com/arewadataScience/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Stage-1-Getting-Started/attendance.md) -->

- **Capstone Project**: Complete a capstone project that demonstrates the ability to apply learned skills to a real-world problem. The project must be approved by the AfroCode Academy Team.
